# Documentation Changes

## Version 0.2 on 19 October 2026

- Make npm, pnpm, Yarn and Bun mandatory for the first release.
- Add an existing-shadcn installation path using `theme add <preset>` and a direct merge into the configured global CSS file.
- Preserve upstream initialization, aliases, component source, unrelated CSS and the project's package manager and lockfile.
- Save the resolved preset during theme application so future library components inherit it.
- Add package-runner examples, a registry theme example, CSS before and after examples, and release criteria for the merge behavior.
- Distinguish a compatible token update from a full visual-family conversion that needs component changes.

The updated commands and guarantees remain development requirements, not an implemented CLI.
